# ADR 0008: Coordinate Native Tools Rather Than Replace Them

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Monad needs durable foundational decisions that are kept in the repository rather than scattered across chat history, private notes, or issue comments.

This ADR records one of the baseline project decisions needed to complete the E0 ADR foundation.

## Decision

Monad will coordinate ecosystem-native tools rather than replacing them wholesale.

## Rationale

This reduces scope, preserves compatibility with real repositories, avoids lock-in, and enables a faster MVP path.

## Alternatives Considered

### Leave the decision implicit

Rejected because implicit decisions are difficult to review, cite, verify, and preserve across sessions.

### Record the decision only in issue comments

Rejected because issue comments are useful operational history but do not replace repo-native architectural decision records.

## Consequences

Monad must handle variation across ecosystems and provide good diagnostics when native tools are missing or misconfigured.

## Implementation Notes

Future implementation work should follow this decision unless a later accepted ADR supersedes it.

## Review / Supersession Notes

Revisit this ADR if implementation experience shows that the decision creates avoidable friction or if a later project phase requires a more precise policy.
